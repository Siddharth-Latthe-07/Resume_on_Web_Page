# Resume_on_Web_Page
In this Project, I have created a web application depicting my resume using Python. I have used streamlit,requests etc and other libraries for the same.
For inserting animantions we have followed a website called "lottiefiles.com"
For inserting images of the project we have created a separate folder in our project and then copied the path in the code
Also you can change the font size,colour and other stuff through streamlit settings.
